# Pain Points

- Learning curve
  - The borrow checker is different
  - No object-oriented programming
- Ecosystem
  - Young, and few maintainers
  - Small (but growing quickly)
- No runtime
  - No runtime reflection
  - No runtime-aided debugging
- Compilation speed
  - Improving, but still slow
  - No pre-built libraries
- Windows
  - Full compiler/std support
  - Limited library support
