# Tooling

Rust has great tools for different parts of a project.

* **Development:** Writing code, dependency management.
* **[Testing](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/testing.html):** Unit, integration, [benchmarking](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/benchmark-tests.html) - are all integrated into the native tools. Other user created tools like [benchcmp](https://github.com/BurntSushi/cargo-benchcmp) and [kcov](https://github.com/SimonKagstrom/kcov) exist for additional quality checks.
* **Releasing:** Building, Publishing.
* **Code Documentation:** Markdown comments with inline code that *actually runs* ([std](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/), [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/)).
* **User Documentation:** Guides can be written in markdown and web pages automatically generated for publishing ([mdbook](https://github.com/azerupi/mdBook)).
