# Conclusion

## What Rust Is Good At

* Large scale maintainable systems
* Embedding into other languages
* *Fast*, *correct* code

## Should You Use Rust?

Yes.

**Should you use Rust *now*?**

Maybe.

Rust is stable at 1.17.0 (at the time of writing), but many of the crates are on versions `0.x.y`. Libraries will continue to change in a non-backwards-compatible fashion before 1.0.

**Rust is, however, fun!**

The language is in a great shape right now for writing real-world applications (i.e. a web browser).
